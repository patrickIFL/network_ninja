first install laravel then create a laravel project:

=> laravel new ninja_network


=> Started learning Laravel by installing Herd
Herd is like laragon. A platform for creating local laravel deployments.
learned about the different folders inside a laravel project.
in the laravel world,
=> eloquent = mongoose.
(ORM vs ODM)
=> Learned about blade. blade is used by laravel to generate views.

=> Started learning about routes.
As you can tell Route in larvel is similar to express.js
exept that return is equivalent to response.

<?php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use Inertia\Inertia;

Route::get('/', function () {
    return Inertia::render('welcome');
})->name('home');

What is Inertia.js?

Inertia.js is a bridge between modern frontend frameworks (like React, Vue, or Svelte) and backend frameworks (like Laravel, Rails, Django, etc.).

It lets you build single-page apps (SPAs) — without creating a separate API or using something like Next.js or Laravel API + React app.

🧠 Think of Inertia as the “glue” that connects Laravel + React like a fullstack framework, without needing REST or GraphQL.

best to install these extensions:
laravel blade
php intellisense

learned about using routes (web.php)
Route::get('/ninjas', function () {
    return view('ninjas.index');
});
clicking this link will run the route navigating to the blade folder. separated by .
<a href="/ninjas" class="btn">Find Ninjas!</a>

declaring a key-value inside the route then passing it to blade view:
return view('ninjas.index', ["greeting" => "hello"]);

accessing it inside the view using blade syntax : {{  }}

learned about wildcards. Route::get('/ninjas/{id}')
in express, its equivalent is passing a dynamic value in the route to be accessed in the link.

learned about blade directives.
in JSX its like:
{greeting === "hello" ? 'hi' : 'goodbye'}
in Blade its like:
@if(true)
<p>Hi from inside the if statement</p>
@endif

note: remember, no {{ }}

Learned to run a @foreach loop to loop through each ninja.

@foreach ($ninjas as $ninja)
            <li>
                <a href="/ninjas/{{ $ninja["id"] }}">
                    {{ $ninja["name"] }}, {{ $ninja["skill"] }}
                </a>
            </li>
        @endforeach

learned about the layout.blade.php = component file
in your view file <x-layout> {{ your contents here }} <x-layout>
in your layout file, you do {{ $slot }}. slot will be the place where the children will be rendered.

you can use this to create reusable(react-like) components

<div class="card">
    {{ $slot }}
    {{-- <a href="{{ $attributes->get('href') }}"> --}}
    <a {{ $attributes }} class="btn">
        View Details
    </a>
</div>

{{ attributes->get('href') }} will only give the href we declared in the instance of our component.
<x-card href='/ninjas/{{ $ninja["id"] }}'>
while $attributes will extract it all then pass it to the declaration of our component.

attributes are legit attributes from html that can be passed to child components

props are non-legit attributes you can pass

how to pass props value to components

:highlight='true'

conditional props
:highlight="$ninja['skill'] > 70">

@props(['highlight' => false]) // default value

<div @class(['!bg-red-300' => $highlight, "card bg-gray-300"])>
// by default, class is "card" if highlight is true add the class.
// note that if you want to override the styles, add an important symbol

laravel serves our code but vite is the one serving the client. so you neet to add the directive in your layout.
@vite('resources/css/app.css') <== Path to your css file.


learned how to create a directive to convert tailwind to plain CSS

.card{
    @apply flex flex-col p-5 bg-gray-300 shadow-xl border border-gray-400;
}

learned that you can do components in larevel as you would with react.

learned about migrations

php artisan make:migration create_todos_table

npx vite --host localhost --port 5173
